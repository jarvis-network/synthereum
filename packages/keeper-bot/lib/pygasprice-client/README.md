# pygasprice-client

Tiny asynchronous client of several gas price APIs (supports ethgasstation, PoaNetwork, Etherchain.org). 

It operates using a background thread, which fetches current recommended gas prices from one of APIs supported
every `refresh_interval` seconds. If due to network issues no current gas prices have been fetched
for `expiry` seconds, old values expire and all `*_price()` methods will start returning `None` until
the feed becomes available again.

## Installation

This project uses *Python 3.6.6*.

In order to clone the project and install required third-party packages please execute:
```
git clone https://github.com/makerdao/pygasprice-client.git
cd pygasprice-client
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Add this repository as git submodule to your project and import gas price clients:

`from pygasprice_client import EthGasStation, POANetwork, EtherchainOrg`

### Supported API clients

#### EthGasStation client
NOTE: please see https://ethgasstation.info/blog/changes-to-egs-api/.  
You have to sign up for an API Key and use it when instantiating EthGasStation client. For backward compatibility reasons client can still be created without a key but this can result in API call failures.

instantiate client as  
`gasprice_api_client = EthGasStation(refresh_interval=10, expiry=600)`  

or with an API key (recommended)  
`gasprice_api_client = EthGasStation(refresh_interval=10, expiry=600, api_key=MY_API_KEY)`

#### Etherchain.org client

instantiate client as  
`gasprice_api_client = EtherchainOrg(refresh_interval=10, expiry=600)`

#### PoaNetwork client

if using public API instantiate client as  
`gasprice_api_client = POANetwork(refresh_interval=10, expiry=600)`  

or pass URL if using a local server as  
`gasprice_api_client = POANetwork(refresh_interval=10, expiry=600, alt_url="http://127.0.0.1:8000")`

### Retrieve gas prices

#### Safe low price
`gasprice_api_client.safe_low_price()`  

#### Standard price
`gasprice_api_client.standard_price()`  

#### Fast price
`gasprice_api_client.fast_price()`  

#### Fastest price
`gasprice_api_client.fastest_price()`
